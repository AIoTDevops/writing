Dcl logistics, like so many American firms, had a problem last year. 

Its business, fulfilling orders of goods sold online, 

faced surging demand. 

But competition for warehouse workers was fierce, 

wages were rising and 

staff turnover was high. 

So dcl made two changes. 

It bought robots to pick items off shelves and 

place them in boxes.

And it reduced its reliance on part-time workers by 

hiring more full-time staff.

“What we save in having temp employees, 

we lose in productivity,” 

explains Dave Tu, dcl’s president. 

Full-time payroll has doubled in the past year, to 280.

As American companies enter another year of uncertainty, 

the workforce has become bosses’ principal concern. 

Chief executives cite worker shortages as the greatest threat to 

their businesses in 2022, 

according to a survey by the Conference Board, a research organisation. 


On January 28th the Labour Department reported that 

firms had spent 4% more on wages and benefits 

in the fourth quarter, year on year, 

a rise not seen in 20 years. 


Paycheques of everyone from McDonald’s burger-flippers to Citi group bankers are growing fatter. 

This goes some way to explaining 

why profit margins in the s&p 500 index of large companies, 

which have defied gravity in the pandemic,


are starting to decline. 


On February 2nd Meta spooked investors by reporting a dip in profits, 

due in part to a rise in employee-related costs 

as it moves from Facebook and its sister social networks into 

the virtual-reality metaverse.

The current jobs market looks extra ordinary by historical standards. 

December saw 10.9m job openings, 

up by more than 60% from December 2019. 

Just six workers were available for every ten open jobs (see chart 1). 

Predictably, many seem comfortable abandoning old positions to seek better ones. 

This is evident among those who clean bedsheets and stock shelves, 

as well as those building spreadsheets and selling stocks. 

In November 4.5m workers quit their jobs, a record. 

Even if rising wages and an ebbing pandemic lure some of them back to work, 

the fight for staff may endure.

For decades American firms slurped from a deepening pool of labour, 

as more women entered the workforce and globalisation greatly expanded the ranks of potential hires. 

That expansion has now mostly run its course, 

says Andrew Schwedel of Bain, a consultancy. 

Simultaneously, other trends have conspired to make the labour pool shallower than it might have been. 


Men continue to slump out of the job market: 

the share of men aged 25 to 54 either working or looking for work was 88% at the end of last year, 

down from 97% in the 1950s. 

Immigration, which plunged during Donald Trump’s nativist presidency, 

has sunk further, 

to less than a quarter of the level in 2016. 

And covid-19 may have prompted more than 

2.4m baby boomers into early retirement, 

according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis.



These trends will not reverse quickly. 

Boomers won’t sprint back to work en masse. 

With Republicans hostile to outsiders and Democrats squabbling over visas for skilled ones, 

a surge in immigration looks unlikely. 

Some men have returned to the workforce since the depths of the covid recession in 2020, 

but the male participation rate has plateaued below pre-pandemic levels. 

A tight labour market may persist.

Both workers and employers are adapting. 

For the most part, they are doing so outside the construct of collective bargaining. 

Despite a flurry of activity—Starbucks baristas in Buffalo and Amazon workers in Alabama will hold union votes in February—unions remain weak. 


Last year 10.3% of American workers were unionised, matching the record low of 2019. 

Within the private sector, the unionisation rate is just 6.1%. 

Strikes and pickets will be a headache for some bosses. 

But it is quits that could cause them sleepless nights.



Pay as they go


Companies’ most straightforward tactic to deal with worker shortages is to raise pay. 

If firms are to part with cash, 

they prefer the inducements to be one-off rather than recurring and sticky, 

as with higher wages. 


That explains a proliferation of fat bonuses.

Before the Christmas rush 

Amazon began offering workers a $3,000 sign-on sweetener. 

Compensation for lawyers at America’s top 50 firms rose by 16.5% last year, 

in part thanks to bonuses, according to a survey by Citigroup and Hildebrandt, a consultancy. 

In January Bank of America said it would give staff $1bn in restricted stock, 

which vests over time.

At the same time, firms of all sizes and sectors are testing new ways to recruit, train and deploy staff. 

Some of these strategies will be temporary. 

Others may reshape American business.
