Many girls had looked forward to 

going to secondary school on March 23rd. 

But the Taliban broke an earlier promise and barred them, 

citing their supposedly immodest uniforms. 



---


And though the Taliban claim to have mellowed 

since they first ran the country in 1996-2001, 

many of them plainly have not. 

Granted, they now allow girls to attend primary school, 

which they banned before. 

But once those girls hit puberty 

they must put down their books and stay out of sight.

The Taliban may have changed dispiritingly little in the past two decades; 

but Afghan society has changed a lot. 

The share of girls who attended primary school rose from zero in 2001 to 85% by 2019. 

For secondary school it was a less impressive 40%. 

A generation of Afghan women has tasted a measure of freedom. 

Their voices have not entirely been silenced. 

Street protests have erupted in Kabul against the closures of girls’ schools. 

Activists lamenting them have appeared on local television. 

Some Afghan men object to the loss of their wives’ income, 

and the hassle of having to accompany them everywhere.

The government’s last-minute u-turn over schools suggests that 

even among the Taliban, there is internal disagreement. 

The outside world must decide how best to encourage the regime’s less repressive elements. 

It is a tricky balancing act. 

Isolating Afghanistan would favour the hardliners; 

lifting all sanctions would reward a brutal regime. 

Overthrowing the Taliban militarily, as the West did in 2001 after they harboured al-Qaeda terrorists, 

is out of the question.

Some donors hope that 

economic pressure might persuade them to change. 

Certain kinds of foreign assistance have been made conditional 

on girls being allowed to go to school. 

American officials have pulled out of talks with the Taliban in Doha, 

where funding for education was to be discussed. 

The World Bank has put $600m of development projects on hold. 

However, history suggests that 

making aid conditional on better behaviour 

by an unwilling regime 

seldom works.

Meanwhile, more than half the population is suffering “acute food insecurity”, 

according to the World Food Programme. 

Earlier this year the un launched its largest-ever appeal for a single country, 

hoping to raise $4.4bn. 


No one is trying to make such emergency aid conditional, 

but nor is the world rushing to feed the 40m struggling Afghans. 

Only 13% of the requested sum had been committed by March 31st, 

when a pledging conference was to open. 

Some of the emergency aid will inevitably leak 

and prop up the Taliban, 

but donors should provide it anyway. 

Human lives are at stake.



---


To send a signal, non-emergency assistance and diplomatic recognition should be withheld 

until female Afghans enjoy their basic rights. 

But the argument must be won within the Taliban. 

No society thrives by hobbling half its population. 

Those that oppress women are more likely to be poor, violent and unstable. 


Some Taliban know this and they must prevail over their reactionary brothers. 


Afghanistan’s future rests on this frail hope.

On march 23rd 

thousands of Afghan girls headed to school for the first time in eight months, 

kitted out in bulging rucksacks, 

neatly pressed headscarves and covid-19 face masks. 

Within hours, they were at home in tears—

and not because of playground fights or test results. 

In a last-minute pivot, the Taliban had 

backtracked on a decision to reopen secondary schools for girls 

and sent them home.

The new Taliban are beginning to look a lot like the old Taliban 

who ran Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, 

when women who failed to cover every inch of flesh in public were beaten 

and adulterers were stoned to death. 

But Afghan women have changed after two decades of American-backed government. 

Many have university degrees. 

Before the Taliban seized power last year, 

almost 30% of civil servants were women. 

On the streets of Kabul book-waving girls have been chanting: “open the schools”.



---


When American forces withdrew from Afghanistan, 

the big question was how the Taliban would make the transition 

from a fundamentalist insurgency to running a country. 

Girls’ education became the litmus test. 

In August there was some hope they wanted to show a gentler face. 

Officials were interviewed by female presenters on television. 

At the Taliban’s first press conference after seizing power, 

a spokesman reassured the world that 

women would be “very active” in Afghan society.

That balancing act seems over. The abrupt u-turn on education, which affects over 1m school-age girls, is one of a string of recent repressive edicts. New rules ban women from travelling long distances without a male chaperone. That can mean they need a brother or a husband to enter a government building or a taxi. A surgeon in Kabul says Taliban officials often visit, warning him not to see female patients who turn up alone. “This is a sad moment for all of us,” he adds.

Years of progress are imperilled. Under the previous democratic government, backed by American troops and money, there was corruption and bigotry. But the female literacy rate more than doubled between 2000 and 2018 to 30%. Thousands of women got jobs as doctors, lawyers or cops. Some became entrepreneurs. Maternal mortality declined sharply and female life expectancy rose by ten years.

Now a generation of girls is falling behind. Some risk their lives to attend underground schools. Sexist violence was a problem even before the Taliban takeover, with 87% of women and girls saying they had suffered abuse. Many teenagers will become mothers before schools reopen.

Life is no better for older women who managed to get an education before last year’s takeover. The Taliban have purged women from most workplaces. In a un survey conducted in October, every single person interviewed knew a woman who had lost her job in the previous month. Qamarulbanat Quraishy has been unemployed since August and is frantically searching for work. But employers are turning away female candidates. Ms Quraishy’s savings have run dry and her debts are mounting. “I have no hope,” says the 24-year-old.

Bigotry affects the economy too. In terms of the increase in hourly earnings from an extra year of schooling, the return on educating girls in Afghanistan was more than double that of educating boys. The children of educated mothers have long been better educated, healthier and likely to earn more later in life. The un reckons that keeping women out of work costs Afghanistan up to $1bn, or 5% of gdp.

In the midst of an economic crisis, the country can ill afford the loss. When the Taliban took over, sanctions stemmed the flow of money. Foreign aid, which made up three-quarters of the state budget, dried up. Ordinary Afghans cannot withdraw savings from local banks. Many have been unpaid for months. Almost the entire population could be desperately poor by the middle of the year.

The chaotic way in which decisions have been announced points to a split between hardliners and pragmatists within the Taliban. Secondary schools received orders not to admit girls only after they had arrived on campus last week. Taliban leaders have been ambiguous about this policy. In some provinces, such as Kunduz and Balkh in the north of the country, girls were allowed to return to school not long after the Taliban takeover. A handful of high-ranking officials continue to educate their daughters overseas.

As Ashley Jackson at the Overseas Development Institute, a think-tank in London, puts it, “competing visions” within the Taliban are playing out in public. The only hope is that decisions that shut women out of public life could be reversed as quickly as they were announced. ■
