The TikTok War Didn’t Cause the TikTok Boom

The video platform had a better quarter than any app ever, 

but despite a slew of videos from the frontlines, 

there’s little evidence that the war boosted its user base.

Dubbing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “the first TikTok war” is by now a cliché,  

but we still have very little insight into 

what that has meant for TikTok itself—

whether the deluge of user-generated content from the frontlines has attracted new users, advertisers, and revenue to the social media app.

When the Gulf War of 1991 announced CNN to the world, 

the financial impact on the cable news trailblazer was soon evident. 

The ensuing surge in viewers and advertisers fueled a 21% increase in the network’s revenue that year, 

the New York Times reported at the time. 

But operating profit actually dropped by 11% because covering a war is expensive:

CNN had to pay war correspondents and satellite transmission fees

while ensuring its staff remained safe from the cruise missiles, air raids, and heavy artillery.

That’s not a problem for TikTok. 

As with almost any social media platform, 

it doesn’t employ the people who generate its content and pays video creators 

only if they get lots of views. 

That means its costs increase only in lockstep with its revenue, 

because more views also mean more advertising impressions, 

which is where TikTok makes most of its money. 

Its privately held parent, Beijing-based Bytedance Ltd., is tight-lipped about its finances.

We do, however, have a pretty good proxy. 

The analytics firm Data.ai, formerly known as AppAnnie, estimates that 

in the three months through March, 

TikTok got more revenue from in-app payments than any app ever has. 

Its users spent $847 million, up 184% from a year earlier—

and more than massive mobile games such as World of Warcraft or Genshin have made in a comparable period.


That revenue, however, is not money that TikTok keeps; 

the platform says it deems all of the money as “tips” users send to video creators. 

We don’t know how much TikTok is making from ads. 

But if tips have increased so much, it would seem likely that ad income has also jumped.

How much of that has to do with the war? 

TikTok had almost 1.6 billion monthly active users at the end of March, 

some 500 million more than it did a year earlier, according to Data.ai. 

That’s a lot, but it’s still less than the users of either Facebook or Instagram (and far less than several other apps that Data.ai doesn’t name).


Significantly, the biggest leap in TikTok’s user growth came in the final quarter last year, months before Russia invaded Ukraine. 

Bytedance did not respond to requests for comment on the numbers.


---

So what’s the upshot? 

The tips data hint 

at a boost in engagement because of the war, 

but most of the recent gains came before the conflict. 

TikTok might be having a cultural moment, 

but it’s more likely a consequence of its existing popularity than a cause.
