The Bridgewater CEO Who Went Full MAGA


David McCormick, who once championed diversity and inclusion under Ray Dalio, 

is now trying to out-Trump Dr. Oz 

in a Pennsylvania race that could become 

the most expensive Senate primary ever.

If you were to pick the high point of David McCormick’s career in finance, 

it might’ve come on a bright summer day in 2019 at the Belle Haven Club, 

a Gatsby-esque waterside retreat in Greenwich, Conn., 

that’s popular with local billionaires.

Among them on this occasion was McCormick’s boss, Ray Dalio, 

the founder of the world’s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates. 

Dalio had gathered the financial elites of Bridgewater and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and brought in Harry Connick Jr. for entertainment, 

to celebrate McCormick’s marriage to Dina Powell, 

who’d recently left a top role in Donald Trump’s administration to return to Goldman.

It was a moment of personal redemption for McCormick. 

Hired as Bridgewater’s president in 2009, he’d survived a full decade at a firm whose paranoid, contentious style is the stuff of legend. 


Dalio enforces a culture of “radical transparency” in which employees are encouraged to make unvarnished criticisms of one another, 

“so there’s no bullshit,” as Dalio puts it.


He’s compared this process—favorably—to a pack of hyenas taking down a wildebeest. 

“This type of apparently ‘cruel’ behavior exists throughout the animal kingdom,” he wrote in a manifesto 

laying out his management principles. 


“Like death itself it is integral to the enormously complex and efficient system that 

has worked for as long as there has been life.” 

At Bridgewater, the aim of this Darwinian struggle is to foster 

a Spock-like intellectual rigor shorn of human emotional frailty,

to better focus the firm on generating returns.

Not everybody loves it. 

Some past employees liken Bridgewater to a cult. 

As a former executive elaborated to AR, a hedge fund trade magazine, 

“It’s isolated, it has a charismatic leader, and it has its own dogma.” 


Employees are known to cry in meetings. 

Not surprisingly, Bridgewater has a steep attrition rate. 

It’s been reported that about 40% of new hires from outside companies quit or 

are fired within a year. 

And the casualties can include senior executives, as McCormick almost found out. 

After he rose quickly to become co‑chief executive officer, the hyenas came for him. 

He received subpar feedback, including from Dalio, and 

was unceremoniously demoted. 

“Ray basically came in and fired me,” McCormick told Bloomberg Businessweek in a recent interview.

But he stuck around and clawed his way back to the top.

Former colleagues say that 

behind his easy grin and natural charisma,

McCormick is a canny operator and tireless networker. 

One describes him as “ruthless with a smile.” 

(Like several other sources for this story, 

the former colleague requested anonymity to speak frankly without fear of retribution.) 

The demotion didn’t stop McCormick from cultivating Dalio. 

A co-captain of the West Point wrestling team who served as a paratrooper in the first Gulf War, 

McCormick took his boss on excursions such as a daylong private visit with a U.S. Army Ranger patrol in the Florida Everglades, 

which included hand-to-hand combat training. 

The rugged bonding rituals appeared to resonate with Dalio, 

who likes to describe Bridgewater employees as “intellectual Navy SEALs.” 

One Bridgewater colleague says McCormick began referring to himself as “the Ray whisperer,” and 

the characterization fit. 

“Ray is a pretty socially awkward guy. David is not,” the former colleague says. 

“It was a pretty important thing for Ray.” 

It was for McCormick, too. 

In 2017 he reclaimed the co-CEO position. Two years later, Dalio promoted him again, to full CEO.
