Slack, a corporate-chat app owned by Salesforce, a software giant, projects 

slowing sales growth to 20% in the next quarter, 

year on year, down from 50% at the height of the pandemic.

In February Zoom reported that 

growth had slowed globally, with revenues in Europe, the Middle East and Africa down by 9%, 

compared with a year earlier, 

and the number of its video-conferencing clients had declined 

relative to the previous quarter. 

Its market value has sunk as a result (see chart).

In one global survey of more than 600 company leaders and human-resources professionals, for example, more than 80% responded that 

hybrid set-ups were emotionally exhausting for employees.



---



By one estimate, spending an average of three days each week in the office can limit encounters between any two workers by 64% compared with pre-pandemic norms. 

The gap widens to 84% in potential interactions for those in the office two days a week.

Rather than continue their rebound as covid clouds clear, airlines, airport operators, travel websites, planemakers, other suppliers and aircraft lessors have lost nearly $120bn in combined market value so far this year (see chart).


---


iata, an industry body, forecast in October that airlines’ fuel bill in 2022 would hit $132bn, accounting for nearly 20% of operating expenses, with a barrel of Brent at $67. 


It now costs nearly twice as much. 


Airline shares have lost around 15% of their value in the past two weeks.

The suspension of Visa and Mastercard payments has made it harder for those members of Russia’s middle class 

who want to flee Mr Putin’s regime to pay for tickets out of the country, for example.



---


The yield on ten-year German bunds, which turned positive only in January, now stands at over 0.6%, even as soaring energy prices darken the growth outlook.



---


Most economists put the neutral level of interest rates, at which monetary policy is pressing on neither the accelerator nor the brake, at around 2-2.5%. 



---



Just a year ago the Fed’s message was that 

it was not even “talking about talking about” tightening monetary policy, 

and investors expected consumer prices to rise by just 2.7% over the following year. 



---



The central bank has raised interest rates from 9.5% to 20%, encouraging people to hold interest-bearing Russian assets.


---



Egypt has also struggled. 

It imports nearly two-thirds of the wheat it consumes, 

the vast majority of which comes from Russia and Ukraine. 


At a pre-pandemic level of consumption, 

Egypt’s annual bill for food and energy imports 

amounts to about 40% of its foreign-exchange reserves (see chart). 


Sensing trouble, foreign investors began pulling money out of the country, 

which in turn forced the government to devalue the currency by 14%. 

On March 23rd it officially sought the imf’s help.

The idea, contained in President Joe Biden’s new budget proposal on March 28th, is that 

Americans worth more than $100m would pay a minimum tax of 20% on all their income, 

including, controversially, the appreciation of their investments. 

If an ultra-rich American makes a paper gain of, say, $10m on his stock portfolio in a year, 

he would face a liability of $2m.

The goal is to close a gaping loophole.

The White House reckons 

the new tax would bring in $360bn over the next decade, 

impressive for a levy that hits the wealthiest 0.01% of households.

According to research published by the imf in 2020, 

over half of non-American and non-eu exports are denominated in dollars. 

In Asian emerging markets and Latin America the share rises to roughly 75% and almost 100%, respectively. 

Barring a modest increase in euro invoicing by some European countries that are not part of the currency union, 

these figures have changed little in the past two decades.



---


Research published in March by Barry Eichengreen, an economic historian at the University of California, Berkeley, shows 

how the dollar’s presence in central-bank reserves has declined. 

Its share slipped from 71% of global reserves in 1999 to 59% in 2021. 

The phenomenon is widespread across a variety of central banks, 

and cannot be explained away by movements in exchange rates.



---

The greenback’s lost share has largely translated into a bigger share for what Mr Eichengreen calls “non-traditional” reserve currencies. 


The yuan makes up only a quarter of this group’s share in global reserves. 

The Australian and Canadian dollars, by comparison, account for 43% of it. 

And the currencies of Denmark, Norway, South Korea and Sweden make up another 23%. 


The things that unite those disparate smaller currencies are clear: 

all are floating and issued by countries with relatively or completely open capital accounts 

and governed by reliable political systems. 

The yuan, by contrast, ticks none of those boxes. 

“Every reserve currency in history has been a leading democracy with checks and balances,” says Mr Eichengreen.



---


Whether the greenback retains its paramount role in the international monetary system or not, 

the holders and users of global currencies will continue to prize 

liquidity, flexibility and reliability. Not every currency can provide them. 


---


During 300 years of imperialism, 

Russia has repeatedly been at war in Europe. 

Sometimes, as with Poland and Finland, it was the invader. 

Other times, as with Nazi Germany and Napoleonic France, 

it was seen as a lethal threat and itself fell victim to aggression.



---

Bringing Ukraine’s governance in line with the eu’s will necessarily be lengthy and bureaucratic. 

The risk is that Brussels strings Ukraine along, 

as if Europe is deigning to let it join. 

Instead, the eu should welcome Ukraine eagerly, 

as eastern Europe was welcomed when it shook off Soviet domination in the early 1990s. 

That calls for generous aid to rebuild the economy, as well as political support and patience.


---


History is littered with wars that 

were meant to be short but which dragged on for years. 

Ukraine has won the first phase of this one simply by surviving. 

Now it needs to advance, and so Mr Zelensky needs redoubled Western help. 

It would be terrible if what stood between a bad peace and a good one was 

a failure of imagination in the capitals of Europe. 




---


Among some 1,500 people polled between March 19th and 22nd, 

73% said they sympathise more with Ukraine than with Russia. 

Yet this disguises a big generational gap. 

Whereas 92% of those aged 65 and over said they sympathise more with Ukraine, 

just 56% of those aged 18-29 did—

a difference of 36 percentage points.



---


Younger Americans are also less bothered about the war’s outcome: 

barely half of those under 30 said they care who wins, 

compared with 90% of those over 65. 

And although Antony Blinken, America’s secretary of state, has formally declared that 

Mr Putin is deliberately targeting civilians, 

younger Americans are not so sure. 

Just 47% of under-30s said Russia was targeting civilians intentionally. 

In contrast, 91% of older Americans agree with Mr Blinken.



---

What might explain it?

One possible reason is that, 

on average, younger people tend to be less engaged in politics. 

Younger people who said they were interested in politics were more sympathetic to Ukraine than their less-engaged peers. 

But the gap between well-informed older Americans and well-informed younger Americans is still wide, 

at 28 points, 

so that can be only part of the story.


---


Perhaps the war seems distant to young Americans 

disillusioned by faraway conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. 

Historical fears of Russia may play a role, too. 

Americans 65 and older came of age during the cold war. 

Those aged under 30 were born after 1992, 

when the Soviet Union had collapsed. 

Yesteryear’s experience may still colour today’s views.
