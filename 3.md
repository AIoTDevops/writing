Mr Gelsinger, a special guest of Mr Biden’s at the state-of-the-union address, 

looked on awkwardly 

as the president said

American firms are watching to see 

if governments advance a global minimum corporate tax—

more than 40% of their foreign direct investment is held in tax havens.

In recent years foreign countries have contributed a declining share of corporate earnings, 

not just because domestic profits have soared but because 

foreign ones have stagnated. 

In the third quarter of 2021 

all American companies (both listed and unlisted) earned 18% of their profits abroad, 

compared with 24% three years earlier (see chart 3).

Overseas markets remain essential to many American companies. 


In 2020 they supplied 28% of the revenue for companies in the s&p 500 index of America’s biggest firms, according to Goldman Sachs. 


The technology industry is particularly outward facing, earning 58% of revenue abroad. 


Companies with higher exposure to foreign markets have outperformed the broader stockmarket over the past half-decade (see chart 1). 


Plenty of firms continue to chase opportunities far from home. 


Last year low interest rates and ample cash inspired American companies to spend $506bn on foreign mergers and acquisitions, 

more than twice the sum in 2020 or 2019, according to Dealogic, a data firm. 

In the first nine months of 2021, the latest figures available, net foreign direct investment had already exceeded the annual total in 2020 (see chart 2).
