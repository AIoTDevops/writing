- On January 28th the Labour Department reported that 

firms had spent 4% more on wages and benefits 

in the fourth quarter, year on year, a rise not seen in 20 years. 



- This goes some way to explaining 

why profit margins in the s&p 500 index of large companies, 

which have defied gravity in the pandemic, 

are starting to decline.

- Men continue to slump out of the job market: 

the share of men aged 25 to 54 

either working or looking for work was 

88% at the end of last year, 

down from 97% in the 1950s. 



- Compensation for lawyers at America’s top 50 firms 

rose by 16.5% last year, 

in part thanks to bonuses, 

according to a survey by Citigroup and Hildebrandt, a consultancy. 



- In September Walmart, America’s largest private employer, 

set its minimum wage at $12 an hour, 

below many states’ requirement of $13-14 

but well above the federal minimum wage of $7.25.




- The average hourly wage for production and nonsupervisory employees in December was 

5.8% above the level a year earlier; 

compared with a 4.7% jump 

for all private-sector workers.




- Angered by the West’s economic sanctions, 

President Vladimir Putin ordered that 

“unfriendly” countries must start paying for Russian natural gas 

in roubles, a demand that 

ministers from the g7 group of countries refused. 




- Gas prices began to rise at the prospect that 

Mr Putin would turn off the taps.






- Even if an embargo has been averted, the latest confrontation surely 

strengthens Europe’s desire to relax 

Mr Putin’s grip on the economy.



- The eu has vowed to slash imports of natural gas from Russia, 

which made up some 40% of its consumption of the fuel last year, 

by two-thirds by the end of 2022.




- When the Trump administration tried to persuade European officials to reduce their reliance on Russian energy

by implementing policies to 

import more liquefied natural gas (lng) from America

—which it dubbed “molecules of freedom”—

the proposal was ridiculed.




- It calls for American help in securing an additional 15bn cubic metres of lng 

for Europe this year 

(equal to roughly a tenth of total European imports of Russian gas in 2021).



- It also promises to “ensure additional eu market demand” for 50bn cubic metres per year 

of the fuel from America by 2030.





- The share of American exports going to Europe 

shot up from 4% in 2017 to almost 30% last year (equivalent to 22bn cubic metres), as prices soared on the continent. 


America “has almost 100% of its liquefaction capacity already in use”, reckons Rystad, a research firm, meaning that 


“there is no additional lng to be exported” in the short term.
