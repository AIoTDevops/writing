- On January 28th the Labour Department reported that 

firms had spent 4% more on wages and benefits 

in the fourth quarter, year on year, a rise not seen in 20 years. 



- This goes some way to explaining 

why profit margins in the s&p 500 index of large companies, 

which have defied gravity in the pandemic, 

are starting to decline.

- Men continue to slump out of the job market: 

the share of men aged 25 to 54 

either working or looking for work was 

88% at the end of last year, 

down from 97% in the 1950s.
