- On January 28th the Labour Department reported that 

firms had spent 4% more on wages and benefits 

in the fourth quarter, year on year, a rise not seen in 20 years. 



- This goes some way to explaining 

why profit margins in the s&p 500 index of large companies, 

which have defied gravity in the pandemic, 

are starting to decline.

- Men continue to slump out of the job market: 

the share of men aged 25 to 54 

either working or looking for work was 

88% at the end of last year, 

down from 97% in the 1950s. 



- Compensation for lawyers at America’s top 50 firms 

rose by 16.5% last year, 

in part thanks to bonuses, 

according to a survey by Citigroup and Hildebrandt, a consultancy. 



- In September Walmart, America’s largest private employer, 

set its minimum wage at $12 an hour, 

below many states’ requirement of $13-14 

but well above the federal minimum wage of $7.25.




- The average hourly wage for production and nonsupervisory employees in December was 

5.8% above the level a year earlier; 

compared with a 4.7% jump 

for all private-sector workers.
